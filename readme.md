### NOT PRODUCTION READY

This is a beta version of the new major release of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/constant-contact-api/">Constant Contact API</a> plugin. Everything has been re-written from the ground up, so there are going to be bugs.

The list of new features is huge. The list of dropped "features" is long, as well.

The biggest thing: moves the plugin over to the new Constant Contact API.

* Requires WordPress 3.3 or Higher
* Requires PHP 5.3 or Higher

### Known issues
* Error handling on Add/Update contact has yet to be converted into WordPress errors
